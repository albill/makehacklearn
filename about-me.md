I'm Al Jigong Billings. This is my blog about making, hacking, and learning as part of my involvement in a hackerspace and technology in general. I don't update it very often because who reads blogs anymore but, hey, it is here.

My employer is [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.com). The Mozilla Community is the proud creator of the Firefox web browser, along with many other projects, as guided by the [Mozilla Manifesto](http://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.html). I work as a program manager on the Platform Security team and manage our team of [fuzzing engineers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing) there.

I've been on the Internet since 1989, when we had to hack into a local dial-up at the University and work out from there through telnet via intermediate university unix boxes. In the golden days, I ran a [UUCP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP) node, pagan.UUCP in order to get Usenet and e-mail. I ran two different Seattle area modem-based bulletin board systems in the late 80's and early 90's: **Revelstone** and **The Sacred Grove**.

I am a co-founder, former president, and former board member of [Ace Monster Toys](http://acemonstertoys.org), a [hackerspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) established in 2010 in Oakland, California. We are a California non-profit and a federal 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. When not engaged in various Buddhist things or my work, much of my time is spent focusing on Ace Monster Toys during the week. I used to commonly blog on Buddhist topics over at my original blog, [Open Buddha](http://www.openbuddha.com). **Make Hack Learn** was created to have a place to just blog about tech topics, geekery, science fiction, and the like, freeing my original blog to just focus on the Buddhadharma. I also play a lot of tabletop role-playing games.

My public PGP key is [here](http://makehacklearn.org/pubkey.txt). My old key is [here](http://makehacklearn.org/oldpubkey.txt). I have made a [signed transition statement](http://makehacklearn.org/transition.txt) for this change.
